# Quark

Quark is a lightweight programming language that lets you write once and generate working code in multiple output languages. It is designed primarily for use in developing microservice communication pathways. It can be used to develop APIs a microservice makes available to other microservices within an application ecosystem or as a mechanism for advertising the features of a new service through simple library publication with automatic documentation generation in the native format used for automated API documentation in the relevant language (if one exists).

Because the same Quark code can be easily generated into multiple languages, each service developer can choose their language of choice without worrying about whether they'll be able to talk to each other - a service primarily using Java can easily handle requests from applications or services built in Python or Javascript. Further, instead of just publishing their API contract and forcing the developers in each language to figure out how to implement code around the specified rules, services built with Quark can generate a client library native to each supported language to be directly included in the services wishing to use it. Using the accompanying generated documentation those client developers can quickly start communicating with a minimal level of effort or need to learn new languages or tooling. 

Quark also allows developers to architect microservices through code.
