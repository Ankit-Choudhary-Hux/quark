This directory contains a number of related docker images useful for
doing end-user install and usage testing of quark and the various
runtime integrations.

Example/reminder:

    docker run -it ubuntu-pip-node bash

The rebuild command can be used to build and locally cache all these
images in one shot. We recommend having good Internet connectivity and
ten minutes to spare when running rebuild.
