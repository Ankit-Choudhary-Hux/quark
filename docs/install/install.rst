Installation
============

This document walks you through the system, application, and tooling requirements for using Quark as well as the actual installation process. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Quark has basic requirements that all users must meet as well as requirements specific to particular output languages and additional requirements needed to run some of the examples provided in the Examples Repository.

Basic Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quark requires a modern Linux distribution or Mac OS X. It has been successfully tested on the following:

* Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite)
* Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitain)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Fedora 22

Quark also requires the following:

* Python 2.7+
* pip
* a local git installation (to access the code base)

In addition the url_get() function requires cURL. It has been tested with cURL 7.43 and is expected to work with any 7.x version of cURL

Java Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Java installed to use any Java code generated by Quark. Quark has been successfully tested with Java 8.

To compile and run the generated code directly from Quark you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x. Maven is not required if you wish to use the generated .java files manually either directly or within an IDE.

Documentation Generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To use the documentation generation feature of Quark with Java, you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x.

Note: Javadoc comments will be generated in the source files as part of the code generation process. You may manually run Javadoc on those files to generate HTML documentation without Maven installed.

Package Generation
++++++++++++++++++

To use the package generation feature of Quark with Java and create a Jar file for your library or application you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x.

Python Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no additional requirements to use Python code generated by Quark.

Documentation Generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To use the documentation generation feature of Quark with Python, you must also install Sphinx 1.3.1 or greater. This can be done by running the following command:

``pip install sphinx``

Note: Documentation source files will be generated without Sphinx as part of the code generation process. Sphinx is only required to generate HTML output from those source files.

Package Generation
++++++++++++++++++

To use the package generation feature of Quark with Python and generate a distributable version of your service or library, you must also install wheel. Quark has been successfully tested with wheel 0.24.0. Use the following command to install wheel:

``pip install wheel``

Note: Python packages generated by Quark are currently missing the Quark runtime and will not result in a working application or library. See issue ^^

Javascript Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Node.js installed to use any Javascript code generated by Quark. Quark has been successfully tested with Node 4.2.1 and is expected to work with any 4.x version of Node. Quark has also been tested with Node 0.12.7; basic features work without any issue but more advanced features of Quark such as blocking url_get() requests are not supported.

Documentation Generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To use the documentation generation feature of Quark with Javascript, you must also install marked version 0.3.1 or greater. If you do not already have npm installed, install npm then run the following command:

``npm install marked --save``

Note: Documentation source files will be generated without marked as part of the code generation process. marked is only required to generate HTML output from the source README.md file.

Package Generation
++++++++++++++++++

To use the package generation feature of Quark with Javascript and generate a distributable version of your service or library, you must also install npm.

Note: Javascript packages generated by Quark are currently missing the Quark runtime and will not result in a working application or library. See issue ^^

Requirements for Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Datawire Directory example uses web sockets and requires additional tools to run in Java, Python, or Javascript:

+------------+------------------+------------------------------------+
| Language   | Requirements     | Install Commands                   |
+============+==================+====================================+
| Java       | netty            | see http://netty.io/downloads.html |
+------------+------------------+------------------------------------+
| Javascript | ws               | ``npm install --save ws``          |
+------------+------------------+------------------------------------+
| Python     | twisted          | ``pip install twisted``            |
+            +------------------+------------------------------------+
|            | autobahn         | ``pip install autobahn``           |
+            +------------------+------------------------------------+
|            | service-identity | ``pip install service-identity``   |
+------------+------------------+------------------------------------+

Installation
------------

To install Quark, do the following:

1. Pull the quark repository from GitHub using the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/datawire/quark.git``

2. Run the following command from the top-level quark directory:

``python setup.py develop``
