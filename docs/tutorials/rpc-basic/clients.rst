Creating the Clients
====================

Let's start by creating a simple Hello World client using the compiled Hello contract in Python.

Note: If you don't want step-by-step guidance about how to create the client and just want to start from a completed client, there is a :ref:`link to the full Python client file <fullExampleClient>` at the bottom of this page.

Part 1: Creating the framework
------------------------------

This section helps you define the necessary structure for your Python client.

Step 1: Create a text file in your favorite editor called pyclient.py

Step 2: Import the integration (why get_runtime? why quark_threaded_runtime when the integration is called datawire_quark_threaded)

Step 3: Import the contract library (hello)

Step 4: Define a main function

Step 5: Run the main function

See :ref:`this page <part1Client>` for the file state at the end of Part 1.
