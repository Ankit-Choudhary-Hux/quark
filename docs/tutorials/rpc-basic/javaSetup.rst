Java Requirements and Setup
===========================

We expect you to have the following tools installed as prerequisites:

* Maven (tested with versions 3.1 and 3.3)

The required {{{netty_integration}}} integration will be installed automatically when you build and package your example; you do not need to explicitly install anything else to write, build, and run the example in Java.
