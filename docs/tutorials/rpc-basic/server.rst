Writing a Server
================

Let's start by creating a simple Hello World server using the compiled Hello contract in Python.

Note: If you don't want step-by-step guidance about how to create the server and just want to start from a completed server, there is a :ref:`link to the full Python server file <fullExampleServer>` at the bottom of this page.

.. _part1ServerFramework:

Part 1: Creating the framework
------------------------------

This section helps you define the necessary structure for your Python server.

Step 1: Create a text file in your favorite editor called pyserver.py

Step 2: Import the portion of the integration needed to run your server, namely get_runtime in quark_threaded_runtime.

Step 3: Import the contract library (hello)

Step 4: Define an empty main function

Step 5: Run the main function. If you are new to Python, information about how to do this can be found `here <https://docs.python.org/2/library/__main__.html>`_.

Part 2: Defining the Response
-----------------------------

This section defines the response using the Response value class defined in the service contract.

Step 1:
