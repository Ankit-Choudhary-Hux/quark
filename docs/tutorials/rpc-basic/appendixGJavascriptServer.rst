Appendix C: Interim Example States - Javascript Server
======================================================

This file provides cross-checks for users who want to ensure they have properly followed the instructions for writing a Javascript server. The sections below show the proper file state at the end of each part of the instructions. If needed, the contents below can be copied into a client code file as a starting point before trying the next section's instructions.

.. _part1JavascriptServerFinished:

Part 1 jsserver.js Initial Setup
--------------------------------

At the end of part 1 of the contract creation, your file should contain the following:

.. code-block:: none

   
:ref:`Return to Part 2 <Part2JavascriptResponseDefinition>` of the server definition to continue the tutorial.

.. _part2JavascriptServerFinished:

Part 2 Response Definition
--------------------------

At the end of part 2 of the contract creation, your file should contain the following:

.. code-block:: none


:ref:`Return to Part 3 <part3JavascriptProcessRequest>` of the server definition to continue the tutorial.

A full copy of the Javascript server for this example can be found `here <https://github.com/datawire/quark/blob/master/examples/helloRPC/jsserver.js>`_ - the file you constructed following the instructions in parts 1-3 of the server definition page should match it exactly excepting comments and @doc annotations.

[[JMK The url above should be branch-specific; once the branch variable is in place and working this can be handled automagically as part of the build.]]
