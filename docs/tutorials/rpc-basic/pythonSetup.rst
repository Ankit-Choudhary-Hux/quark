Python Requirements and Setup
=============================

We expect you to have the following tools installed as prerequisites:

* Python (tested with version 2.7)
* pip
* Quark (see :doc:`basic setup instructions <setup>` if needed)

If you haven't already done so, run the following command to install the Quark Python threaded integration:

``pip install datawire-quark-threaded``
