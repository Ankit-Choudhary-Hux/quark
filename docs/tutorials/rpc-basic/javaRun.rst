Running the Java Client and Server
==================================

We now have all of the pieces needed for a simple working RPC example. The instructions on this page assume you have already followed the directives for building and installing the HelloRPC service contract in Java as outlined on the :doc:`Compiling and Installing the Library page <javaBuild>` earlier in the tutorial. If you have not done this, please do so now before trying the steps below.

To run the HelloRPC example with a Java client and Java Server do the following:



That's it! You should now understand how to define clients and servers to use the basic RPC interaction pattern defined in Quark and have seen those clients and servers in action in Java. You can see the clients and servers running in multiple languages :doc:`here <try>`. or just experiment some more on your own with Java!
