Introduction
============

Quark lets you define and implement rich (micro)service APIs that work with your existing application frameworks. Quark lets you:

* Rapidly prototype and iterate service APIs
* Build service APIs with rich protocol semantics
* Support multiple programming languages and application frameworks

In addition to developing and implementing APIs, Quark also offers a packaging service for each of its component languages, allowing easy distribution and advertising of service availability to potential users. Quark also generates API documentation for your libraries in standard formats for each language (when they exist) including Javadoc for Java and Sphinx for Python.

This document focuses on the language elements of Quark and provides some context around how the language is structured as well as reference documentation for specific language elements.
