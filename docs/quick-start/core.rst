Core Concepts
=============

Quark is a Turing-complete language designed primarily for facilitating microservice communication pathways although it is not limited to this function.

Quark uses many of the standard elements of object-oriented programming languages including packages, interfaces, classes, methods, properties, functions, variables, annotations, operators, and keywords. It includes inheritance, method and operator overloading, and property and method overriding capabilities.

Quark may be used to write libraries or applications. Applications must contain a single top-level main() function containing the executions structure for the application; this function may reference code from any defined class or package within the application.

Quark code is stored in text files with a .q file extension.

See the :ref:`Quark Language Reference <../language-reference/index>` for more specifics about language structure and language elements.
