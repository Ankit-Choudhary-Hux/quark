version_declaration_compiler_outdated.q:1:1: Compiler version is incompatible with source

    The source file declares the following compiler version spec:
      ==999.0.0
    However, the compiler you are running has the following version:
      0.6.100
    Which does not match the spec. You need to either update your source
    or switch to a compiler version that matches the spec.
