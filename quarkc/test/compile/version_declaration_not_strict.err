version_declaration_not_strict.q:1:1: Quark version spec malformed

    The quark version spec is malformed. It should be located on the
    first line of your file, like this:

        quark 0.7.0;

version_declaration_not_strict.q:1:1: The quark version is incompatible with the source version.

    Your source code declares the following quark version:

        quark 0.6.100;

    However, you are running version 0.7.0. You need to
    either update your source or install the correct version of quark.

    For info about any fixes and improvements, as well as info on how
    to upgrade your source code if there have been breaking changes in
    the library, please review the CHANGELOG:
