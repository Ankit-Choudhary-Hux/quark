version_declaration_source_outdated.q:1:1: The source file declares the following version of the compiler:
      0.0.1
    However, the compiler you are running has the following:
      0.6.100
    The two versions are incompatible. You need to either:

      * Downgrade your compiler to 0.0.1, or

      * Updated your source to 0.6.100 by changing the
        version declaration to 0.6.100, as well as by
        following the change log for version 0.6.100
