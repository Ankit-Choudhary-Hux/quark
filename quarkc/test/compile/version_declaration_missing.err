version_declaration_missing.q:1:1: Source code version declaration is missing.

    As of quark version 0.7.0, your source code must indicate what
    version of the quark toolchain (language/library) it uses by
    declaring the quark version at the beginning of each top level
    file:

        quark 0.7.0;

    To explicitly override this check, use:

        quark *;

    Source code version declarations were introduced in Quark 0.7.0 in
    order to:

      a) quickly detect incompatibilities between quark source code
         and the quark toolchain in use

      b) make it as easy as possible to update to the latest version
         of the toolchain

    If this file is written against a prior version of the quark
    toolchain, you can either downgrade to that version, or upgrade
    this source file to work with currenct compiler version
    (0.7.0). This requires declaring compiler version as
    the first line of any top level file (files that have a package
    declaration):

        quark 0.7.0;

    For info about any fixes and improvements, as well as info on how
    to upgrade your source code if there have been breaking changes in
    the library, please review the CHANGELOG:
