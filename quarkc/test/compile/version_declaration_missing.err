version_declaration_missing.q:1:1: Version declaration is missing.

    Note: Your file should start with Quark compiler version
    declaration, like this:

        quark 0.6.100;

    Details: version declarations were introduced in Quark 0.7.0
    in order to quickly detect breaking changes. If this file
    is written against prior version of Quark, you can either:

     * Downgrade Quark compiler to that version, or

     * Upgrade this source file to work with currenct compiler
       version (0.6.100). This requires:

        * Declaring compiler version as first line of your file:

              quark 0.6.100;

        * Fixing any incompatibilities, by following the change
          log for version 0.6.100
